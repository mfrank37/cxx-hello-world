# C++ hello world

## Introduction

C++ Hello World is the simplest program that any beginner learning C++ should try.

## How to run

- clone this repository

        git clone https://github.com/mfrank37/cxx-hello-world.git

- Make sure you have installed a compiler of your choice. Mine is [GNU GCC](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)

- Now after installing a compiler call it from your `terminal`

        g++ --version

- Great! If you can see the version of the compiler you are ready to run. If not try setting the environment variables your compiler's `bin` directory into system's path environment variables.

- Open your terminal from the project's root folder then run
        
        g++ hello.cpp -o hello

- Now you should see an executable file called hello to run your Cool program. On windows it should be `hello.exe`

- Finally you can run on Windows

        hello.exe

- Or you can run on other systems/terminals such as `bash` or `powershell`

        ./hello

- Congratulations! üëèüí• 

You have now made your first step in learning and mastering C++.
